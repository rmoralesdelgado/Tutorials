# Tutorials

Hello there!

This Tutorials repository is the consolidation of notes I made about some specific topics. They do not pretend to be absolute guides nor replace any formal documentation or literature. They are the reflection of me delving into different subjects and finding my way through these topics.

In the following lines, you will find a brief description of the content of each of the tutorials contained in this repository.

## [01 Quick and Sustainable Git and GitHub](https://github.com/rmoralesdelgado/Tutorials/blob/master/01%20Quick%20and%20Easy%20Setup%20for%20Git%20and%20GitHub.md)

The objective of this tutorial is to provide an easy and quick setup guide for both Git and GitHub — making them both work together — and to give some simple and core understanding of both tools such that the reader can develop a simple but sustainable workflow that allows it to integrate `git` and GitHub as part of its everyday tools.

## [02 Setting Up a Jupyter Notebook Server on a Virtual Machine](https://github.com/rmoralesdelgado/Tutorials/blob/master/02%20Setting%20Up%20a%20Jupyter%20Notebook%20Server%20on%20a%20Virtual%20Machine.md)

The objective of this tutorial is to show how to set up a Jupyter Notebook server on a virtual machine, specifically in an AWS EC2 VM. This tutorial also presents a feature to prevent from the effects of connection interruptions, between the local computer (e.g. your machine) and the server, on the Jupyter notebooks opened and any running subprocesses.

## [03 Derivation of a Forward and a Backpropagation Pass on a Feedforward Neural Network](https://github.com/rmoralesdelgado/Tutorials/blob/master/03%20Derivation%20of%20a%20Forward%20and%20Backpropagation%20Pass%20on%20a%20Feedforward%20NN.pdf)

The objective of this tutorial is to demonstrate, through thorough calculations, how to derive a forward pass and a backpropagation pass through a feedforward neural network (FFNN) of $n$ inputs, one hidden layer with $m$ nodes, and $p$ outputs. In this sense, this tutorial aims to be a general case application for any FFNN with a single hidden layer.

## [04 Anaconda, zsh and MacOS Catalina](https://github.com/rmoralesdelgado/Tutorials/blob/master/04%20Conda%2C%20zsh%20and%20MacOS%20Catalina.md)

The objective of this tutorial is to show how to *re-enable* command-line applications, namely those default in MacOS distributions like `git`, and user-installed Anaconda, that would not launch or work after installing MacOS Catalina and its new default shell, `zsh`.
